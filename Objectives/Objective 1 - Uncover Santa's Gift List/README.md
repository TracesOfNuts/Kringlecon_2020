## Solution

This is the landing page of Kringlecon 2020. Clicking on Jingle Ringford will reveal the first objective.

Basically there is an image on the Billboard on the top left-hand corner:

We can see the twirl image at the bottom.

Using the tool provided in the link we can untwirl the image:

Now, we can see what Santa is planning on giving Josh Wright.
